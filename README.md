## Abstract
This study assesses the consumption effects of introducing a processed and red meat tax in the United States. We do this by estimating price elasticities for American households using an Instrumental Variable approach, and the Instrument we use is the price effects of the 2011-2012 drought. Using the Nielson homescan dataset, we estimated a two-stage pooled-IV model for unprocessed and processed red meats consumption. The estimated accounts for price endogeneity and household non-purchases. The results demonstrated that processed red meat price elasticity of demand for American households is at -0.29, suggesting a small consumption response to a processed meat tax.
